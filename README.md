# Sequelize in MySQL
- I will be working with sequelize in NodeJS to interact with MySQL database.
- You need to create ".env" file for the project. a typical ".env" content and values are given for reference.
```javascript
DB="mysql"
SCHEMA="sequelize-work"
ADMIN="root"
PASS="NEWPASSWORD"
HOST="localhost"
PORT=3306
```
- Use "**npm i**", then "**npm start**" to start the server.

# Additional Notes:
- zlib and bcrypt used for this project.
- All the sequelize related notes can be found in "dataManipulation.js" and "userModel.js".

# Keywords:
- **sequelize-associations**: it is useful to create associations for different tables for one to one, one to many and many to many relations.
